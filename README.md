# Kanban-board-Application
An interactive Kanban board application using React JS

This project implements a dynamic Kanban board that allows users to manage and organize tickets efficiently. The board provides flexibility in how tickets are displayed, with options for grouping and sorting to better suit the user's needs.

## Grouping Options

Users can click the **Display** button to choose how they would like to group the tickets. There are three distinct grouping options available:

1. **By Status**: This option groups tickets based on their current status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
2. **By User**: Tickets are arranged based on the user to whom they are assigned.
3. **By Priority**: Tickets are grouped according to their priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

## Sorting Options

In addition to grouping, users can also sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

1. **Priority**: Sort the tickets in descending order of priority, from high to low.
2. **Title**: Sort the tickets alphabetically in ascending order by their title.

These features provide a customizable and intuitive way to organize and view tickets according to user preferences, making the Kanban board a powerful tool for project management.

## How to Use

1. Click on the **Display** button to select your preferred grouping option.
2. Choose your sorting preference (Priority or Title) to further organize the displayed tickets.

This project aims to enhance productivity and provide an effective visual interface for managing tasks and workflows.
